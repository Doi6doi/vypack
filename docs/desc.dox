/**
vypack is a simple C program which allows you to pack an interpreter 
(like Python, Node, PHP, or any other) together with your program and
optional resource files. You can also add the needed external libraries 
or interpreter modules. It creates a single binary of your operating 
system which can be transferred to other systems and run without
being installed.
